;; To understand what's happening here, it would be a good idea to
;; read through this document:

;; https://m.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:SPARQL_query_service/queries

;; The first challenge when using Wikidata is finding the right IDs
;; for the properties and entities you must use to phrase your
;; question properly. We have functions to help:

(entity "U2")
;;=> "Q396"

;; Now we know the ID for U2... or do we? Which U2 is it, really?

(describe (entity "U2"))
;; "Irish alternative rock band"

;; No, that's not the one I wanted! Happily, we can refine the request
;; by adding extra criteria:

(describe (entity "U2" :part-of (entity "Berlin U-Bahn")))
;; -> "underground line in Berlin"

;; We also have functions that turn keywords into property values:
(property :instance-of)
;;=> "P31"


;; ... but we use it indirectly through a set of helper functions
;; named for Wikidata namespaces, like wdt, p, ps and pq. The link
;; above will help you understand which one of these you might want
;; for a given query, but it's most often wdt.
